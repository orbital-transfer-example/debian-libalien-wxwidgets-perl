libalien-wxwidgets-perl for Debian
----------------------------------

This package is, for the most part useless.  That is, it is not useful on its
own.  It is a dependency of libwx-perl.  I imagine that other packages which
need to determine information about the installed wxWidgets could also use it.
However, there are no others of which I am aware.
