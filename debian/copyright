**********************************************
Upstream sources are repackaged

Since upstream-provided tarball contains files without license, it has to be
repackaged. The following items are removed:

o inc/src/
  contains files without a license

o inc/bin/patch.exe
  supposedly the result of compiling the above sources. removed as it becomes
  sourceless after inc/src removal

In order to repplay the repackaging, debian/repack.sh can be provided. Easiest
to jsut rin `uscan --force', which will download the tarball from upstream and
give it to debian/repack.sh
