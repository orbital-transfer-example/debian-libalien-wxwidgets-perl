Comment: Since upstream-provided tarball contains files without license, it has to be
 repackaged. The following items are removed:
 .
 + inc/src/: contains files without a license
 + inc/bin/patch.exe: supposedly the result of compiling the above sources.
   removed as it becomes sourceless after inc/src removal
